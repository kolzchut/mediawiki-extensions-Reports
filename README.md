# WikiRights Report extension for MediaWiki

NOTE: this is a custom extension for Kol-Zchut (kolzchut.org.il).
      It was not designed with public use in mind.


This extension adds special report pages for stuff we need, such as "how many pages were updated since X".
While this exists in some form in MediaWiki already, it doesn't take into account our specific requirements and filters.

## Usage
Special pages:
- Special: ArticlesUpdatedReport
